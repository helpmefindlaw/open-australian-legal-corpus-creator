## Changelog ðŸ”„
All notable changes to the Open Australian Legal Corpus Creator will be documented here. This project adheres to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
## Added
- Introduced the `when_scraped` field of documents.
- Started retrying requests when parsing errors are encountered to cope with servers being overloaded but returning successful status codes.
- Added support for Python 3.10 and 3.11.

## Changed
- Switched from `attrs` and `orjson` to `msgspec` in order to speed up and simplify the serialisation and deserialisation of Corpus data.
- Began storing Corpus data as arrays rather than dictionaries in order to speed up serialisation and deserialisation and also compress the data.
- Made minor micro-optimisations by replacing lambda functions with named functions.

### Fixed
- Skipped scraping web pages from the NSW Legislation database that contain the substring 'No fragments found.' due to a newly identified bug in the database (see, eg, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/2021-03-25/act-1944-031).
- Skipped scraping web pages from the Tasmanian Legislation database that contain the substring 'No fragments found.' due to a newly identified bug in the database (see, eg, https://www.legislation.tas.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/act-2022-033).
